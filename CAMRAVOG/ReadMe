Hey there, this file will contain a few details about the site so you
and any future developer can get a quick understanding of the basics.

Firstly, PHP is used throughout the website, as is Javascript; I personally
used the PHPStorm IDE to develop the website although most other IDE's for web development
should work.

Secondly, The website is responsive, yay!
Now onto the bigger stuff,

* The Awards Page *
You will, without a doubt, be changing these from time to time, thus the images have been named according to
their award header, rename the new winners images to the same name of the old winners, then replace the old with
the new image.
If the text is too small then use the element class 'textFit' within the <p> element
If the text is too large/overflows then get rid of this class.

[EXAMPLE]
<p class="textFit"> some text... </p>

(Note: if the class is not assigned and the text still overflows then you will have to reduce
the size of the content; but this is very unlikely to happen).


* Extra Features *

For those who access the site with a poor internet connection I have included a three stage
loading process for the banner at both the top and bottom of the page.
    'header-backdrop-min'   >> This is the worst quality image, it will load in mili-seconds for
          (182x102)            anyone with regular 2G connnection [this is a poor connection speed].
    'header-backdrop-tiny'  >> This is an okay quality image, it will load for anyone with regular
          (285x160)            3G connection within mili-seconds [this is an okay connection speed].
    'header-backdrop-full'  >> This is the high quality image, it will load quickly for anyone with
         (4571x2571)           a good 3G connection or higher [This is the average connection speed].
Each image will load in sequence, replacing eachother when the next best quality is finished loading,
this is a seamless transition and the user experiance will not be affected in any negative way.
If you want to replace this with a new image I recommend using 'https://unsplash.com/' which is a completely
free, copyright free, website where creators will allow you to download high quality images. I Promise it is copyright free!
Take the downloaded image (this is the h-b-full image) and make two copies using 'http://www.imageoptimizer.net/Pages/Home.aspx'
Each time reducing the width and height, this will make them smaller and thus decreasing the quality. The sizes I used are listed
under the names above.
